wireframing

1. Key Elements in a Wireframe:

   - Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
   - Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
   - Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
   - Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

2. Types of Wireframes

   - Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality
     without detailed design.
   - High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more
     specific layout and design elements.
